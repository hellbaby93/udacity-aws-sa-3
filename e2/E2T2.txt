From AWS Config, the following insights and recommendations were collected:
- HTTP request to ALB should drop invalid headers
- ALB Logging should be enabled
- ALB should redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- ALB delete protection should be enabled
- EC2 instances should be managed by SSM
- EC2 instances should have no public IP and should not be accessible directly from the Internet
- EC2 instances' metadata version should be configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2
- S3 buckets public access should be prohibited
- S3 buckets should accept HTTPS request only
- S3 buckets should have life cycle policy check enabled

From AWS inspector:
- Restrict access to instances by modifying the Security Groups or ACLs in the network path.

Security Hub:
- The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
- CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
