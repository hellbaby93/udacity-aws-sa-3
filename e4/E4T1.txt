# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Disable remote login to the instance
2. Only allow connection from public subnet by updating security group.
3. Implement AWS WAF on internet facing resources

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Enable encryption on the bucket, update IAM Role so that only privileged business users have access to the bucket and have permission to use KMS to decrypt objects in bucket
2. Block all public access to the bucket. Update Bucket Policy to allow a certain set of resources to be able to access the bucket
